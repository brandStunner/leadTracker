# title(){return this.options.title||this.options.name}

How often do you bookmark a page? Ok what if you want to save a url you have not searched yet?
Now how about booking in a way so that you can track these sites later?
This project helps you save your current tab you've opened, enables you to input a url you wish to search later 
all in the same space, how cool is that?
